Immutability makes complex features much easier to implement. Later in this tutorial, we will implement a “time travel” feature that allows us to review the tic-tac-toe game’s history and “jump back” to previous moves. This functionality isn’t specific to games — an ability to undo and redo certain actions is a common requirement in applications. Avoiding direct data mutation lets us keep previous versions of the game’s history intact, and reuse them later.

// Challenges faced
Currently adding react to rails app
Read up on react-rails, and many others, but none is useful and clear
There is no one size fits all tutorial. I really have to understand what's happening at each stage of the developement so that I don't use the wrong route. Though debuggin is fun and an important part of the process, it's not as time friendly if I don't know what I am copying. I rebuild and redesign my app 3 times.
